# Ethics & Safety

- **Non-diagnostic**: The risk score is heuristic and not a medical diagnosis.  
- **Transparency**: Scoring weights and logic are in code and documented in the UI.  
- **Bias & Limitations**: Inputs are limited and may not capture clinical nuance.  
- **Harm mitigation**: High-risk output includes guidance to contact a clinician; emergency cases should use local emergency services.
